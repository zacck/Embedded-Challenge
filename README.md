# Embedded-Challenge
A nice little challenge I learnt of in Discord that I would like to Implement.


So first, get a blinky to work, just to Flash an led. 

Then, output a pwm signal and read an RC filtered version of that back into the adc.

Then, get uart to work and send this data to the pc.

Then if you want you can take a look at the USB, and get a USB dfu bootloader to work.
